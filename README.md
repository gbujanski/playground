# 🧪 Playground Repository for Learning and Experimentation

This repository is my personal **playground for testing and learning**. I use it to freely experiment with various technologies, frameworks, and solutions — especially the ones I'm not very experienced with.

## 🎯 Purpose

The main goal of this repository is to **understand and explore specific concepts**, such as:

- microservices environment setup,
- how API gateways work,
- microfrontend configuration,
- comparing different ways to solve the same problem using various programming languages or frameworks,
- building something from scratch that I’ve previously only seen or used, but never implemented myself,
- and other topics I’m currently interested in or struggling with.

## ⚠️ Code Quality Disclaimer

**Code quality is not a priority in this repository.**  
My goal here is to quickly reach a working result that helps me understand how something works.

That means:

- I often ignore best practices,
- the code may be messy, inconsistent, or poorly structured,
- some solutions may be quick-and-dirty or temporary hacks,
- a significant portion of the code was **generated by AI** or **copied directly from official documentation or internet forums** — often left exactly as-is, with only minimal changes needed to make it work in my setup.

Maybe one day I’ll revisit these ideas and implement them properly, following clean code principles —  
**but that’s not the purpose of this repo right now.**

## 🛠️ Status

This repository is constantly evolving and may contain incomplete or experimental code.  
If you’ve stumbled upon it by accident — now you know what to expect. 😉

## 📂 Structure

The structure of the project might change depending on what I’m currently testing.  
Don’t get too attached — I don’t either.

## 🚀 How to Run

This repository is fully Dockerized and designed to be launched with a **single command** using Docker Compose.

### 🧩 Basic Setup

1. Navigate to the `docker` directory:

   ```bash
   cd docker
   ```

2. Copy the example environment file and rename it:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

3. Open the .env file and set the environment variables as needed.
These variables are used throughout the Docker Compose configuration to ensure that each service or frontend receives the appropriate setup.

### ▶️ Starting the Environment

Once your .env file is configured, run:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

This will build and start all microservices and microfrontends defined in the Compose file.

### 📁 Notes
Each microservice and microfrontend that requires containerization includes its own Dockerfile, located in the respective project folder.

If you want to learn more about how a specific project works, check the README.md inside that project's folder.

### ⚠️ Important Reminder

Keep in mind that this is a **testing and learning project**,  
so some parts might **not always work perfectly**,  
and some `README.md` files in subprojects may be **incomplete or outdated**.

If you encounter any issues, it's usually related to the experimental nature of this repository.
